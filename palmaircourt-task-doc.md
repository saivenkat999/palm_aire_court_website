cd C:\Projects\website\PalmAireCourt\PalmAireCourt

# Install dependencies (if not done)
npm install

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Run database migrations (if database is set up)
npx prisma migrate dev

```

### Access Points:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5000
- API: http://localhost:5000/api

### Current Status

### ✅ Successfully Tested
- **Server runs successfully** on port 5000 after fixing Windows compatibility issue
- **Frontend loads properly** at http://localhost:5000
- **Basic navigation works** between all pages
- **Mock data is available** in JSON files for units, rates, amenities, FAQs
- **UI renders correctly** with placeholder images and content
- **Database schema is prepared** using Prisma with PostgreSQL
- **API endpoints are implemented** and connected to Prisma (though no data seeded)

### ⚠️ Issues Found
1. **Windows Compatibility Issues**:
   - NODE_ENV variable not recognized in npm scripts (Windows format needed)
   - Socket binding issue with host: "0.0.0.0" (fixed by removing host parameter)
   - tsx command not available globally (needs npx prefix)

2. **Database Not Configured**:
   - Using local Prisma Postgres URL but no data seeded
   - Migrations not run
   - No sample data in database

3. **Mock Data vs Real Data Confusion**:
   - Project has mock JSON data in `/client/src/data/`
   - But API routes expect data from Prisma/database
   - Mismatch between frontend expectations and backend implementation
